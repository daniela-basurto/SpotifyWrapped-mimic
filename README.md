# SPOTIFY WRAPPED
This code will be using Spotify's API as well as Google Spreadsheets to creat your very own Spotify Wrapped. 
The code will first grab the indecated songs from your Spotify account and send them to a Google Spreadsheet which can then be used using a web app called glide. 
Glide is an app builder you can usse as part of this project to make the data look more user friendly.
Glide allows you to import the Google Spreadsheet in which all data will be stored and creat the visual of your own app.
